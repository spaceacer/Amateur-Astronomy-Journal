# Amateur-Astronomy-Journal
Personal log of my amateur astronomy observations — including the Moon, planets, and ISS — along with astronomy-related Python scripts for analysis.

# 🌌 Amateur Astronomy Log

Welcome to my personal log of amateur astronomy observations — a place where I document what I see in the night sky, from the Moon and planets to satellites like the ISS. I also share astronomy-related Python scripts for tracking celestial events and objects.

## 🔭 What’s in this Repo?

### 🗒️ Observations
Logs of my skywatching sessions, including:
- 🌕 Moon phases, craters, and terminator lines
- 🪐 Saturn and its rings
- 🔴 Mars and visible features
- 🌍 International Space Station (ISS) passes
- ☄️ Meteor showers and deep-sky objects

Each log typically includes:
- 📅 Date and time
- 🌍 Location
- 🔧 Equipment used
- 🌤️ Weather conditions
- 📝 Notes and photos

> See the `observations/` folder.

### 🧠 Python Code
Python scripts I've written for amateur astronomy, such as:
- `iss_tracker.py` — Track the next visible ISS flyover for your location
- `moon_phase_calculator.py` — Determine the moon phase for any date
- `planet_rise_set.py` — Get rise/set times for visible planets
- `generate_star_chart.py` — Create a basic sky map (requires matplotlib + Skyfield)

> See the `code/` folder.

## 📸 Images
Raw and processed images from my sessions:
- Telescopic and phone-captured shots
- Labeled annotations (if any)

> See the `images/` folder.

## ⚙️ Requirements

To run the Python scripts:
```bash
pip install skyfield numpy matplotlib

If you’re into astronomy too — whether you’re just starting out or deep into the cosmos — feel free to open an issue or start a discussion. I’d love to hear what you're observing, what gear you use, and share ideas or code improvements!
